In Sri Lanka university industry collaboration is only limited to industry talks, workshops and guest lectures. That also only limited to urban universities in the island. Strong collaboration among the society is a way to develop this country. So, in this small island why we can’t be getting together and lift the community and country as well.  **SL 2 INDUSTRY** is the platform we built for fill this gap. Through this platform the provided collaboration can be vary as follows,<br>
**1.	Research collaboration:**<br>
Research collaboration is one among that and industries can upload problems to be solved and University students can take over these as their final research projects and deliver it with the mentoring of industry and with the academic supervisor. Students also can upload their queries that need support from the industry to be solved.
For example, in industry there are professionals who willing to do research but have no time. In universities there are undergraduates who like to do research but don’t have mentorship. We are filling this gap between university and industry using this platform.<br>

**2.	Career collaboration:**<br>
University can share the academic calendar which include some important dates such as when students will be ready for interns and employment. Industry can share internship/job opportunities they have with particular university. When students will get academic breaks. Such information will be useful for students and industry as well.<br>

**3.	Event collaboration:**<br>
Some annual events organized by different industries can be made visible to universities and students can prepare for such events well in advance. This may be meet ups, Competitions or hackathons or any other matter that can be done in a collaborative way. This may be same the annual events organized by universities and expecting other universities to participate, and industries can sponsor for such important events.

<h1 align="middle">Analysis of the system</h1>
<h2>Users of The System</h2>

**1.	Industry Coordinator:** person who is represent particular company. There can be multiple coordinators from each company. 

**2.	University Ambassador:** student who is representing particular university. There is only one ambassador for one university. Ambassadors are selected by google form annually.

**3.	University Student:** undergraduates of universities. They have their own personal accounts with categorizing into universities, but they have very limited privileges to do their own. All student’s actions are going through the ambassador.

**4.	People:** anyone can visit the webpage and see public events and posts but to make an account it’s must to have an email address which is provided by your university.

<h2>Used Technologies</h2>

**1.	Java Server Phase (JSP):** JSP is a technology we use to crete dynamically generated web pages based on HTML, XML.

**2.	Spring MVC/Spring-boot:** we use Spring MVC design pattern to breakdown development process into 3 tires,
Presentation layer: we create views to create UI
Logical layer: we use controllers to process
Database layer: we use models to connect with database and handle data
By using this we can reduce our workload and make the development process easy and more convenient.

**3.	MySQL:** we use MySQL to store and fetch the data.

**4.	JavaScript/ CSS/ HTML/ Bootstrap/ jQuery:** used for frontend designing
